# Email Spam Classifier

## Introduction

This GitHub repository hosts an Email Spam Classifier that employs the Naive Bayes Algorithm for email classification. Email spam, or unsolicited and unwanted email, is a pervasive problem in the digital age. Email providers and users alike benefit from effective spam filters that help separate legitimate messages from spam.

## Naive Bayes Algorithm

The Email Spam Classifier utilizes the Naive Bayes Algorithm, a supervised classification technique rooted in Bayes' Theorem. What sets Naive Bayes apart is its assumption of independence among predictors, which means that it considers each feature's contribution to the classification independently. In the context of email spam classification, this implies that the presence of a particular word or feature in an email is considered unrelated to the presence of any other word or feature.

## Key Features

1. **Naive Bayes Classifier:** The core of this project is a Naive Bayes Classifier that has been trained on a dataset of labeled emails. It uses statistical probabilities to determine whether a given email is likely to be spam or not.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The repository includes scripts and tools for preprocessing email data. This involves techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and feature extraction to convert the raw text of emails into a format suitable for machine learning.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:** To assess the performance of the Email Spam Classifier, we employ commonly used evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the classifier distinguishes between spam and non-spam emails.

4. **Easy Integration:** The classifier can be easily integrated into existing email systems or applications. Its straightforward API allows for seamless integration, making it a valuable tool for email providers and users looking to enhance their spam filters.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Email Spam Classifier, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the repository's documentation.

3. **Train the Classifier:** Use the provided training dataset to train the Naive Bayes Classifier. Adjust hyperparameters as needed for your specific use case.

4. **Integration:** Integrate the trained classifier into your email system or application.

5. **Evaluate:** Monitor the classifier's performance using the provided evaluation metrics and make improvements as necessary.
